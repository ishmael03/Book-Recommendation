    "#### What is a Recommendation System?\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation systems are tools and technologies that suggest items to users based on various criteria. These items could be movies, books, products, or even other users' profiles.  The primary goal of a recommendation system is to personalize the user experience by identifying and suggesting items that are most relevant or appealing to an individual user or a group of users.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Type of Recommendation Systems:\n",
    "1. Content-Based Filtering: Recommends items similar to those a user has liked in the past, based on the features of items. \n",
    "2. Collaborative Filtering: Based on the preferences of other users who have similar tastes or preferences. It can be divided into 2 subgroups:\n",
    "    - User-Based: Recommends items by finding users similar to the current user and suggest items those similar users have liked\n",
    "    - Item-Based: Recommends items that are similar to items the user has liked in the past, based on user ratings/interactions"
