# Bank Churn 

Bank Churn Prediction Project
Project Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn for a bank. We explore various machine learning models to identify which can most accurately predict churn based on historical customer data. The models evaluated include K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Random Forest, and Logistic Regression.

Objective
The objective of this project is to help the bank reduce customer churn by identifying at-risk customers before they leave, allowing the bank to take proactive measures to retain them.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes customer information such as age, balance, membership duration, and transaction history. (Note: Adjust this section based on the actual data you used.)

Excute
To run the analysis, open the Bank_Churn.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter environment and execute the cells sequentially.

Models Evaluated
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
Random Forest
Logistic Regression
Each model's performance is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Results
The Random Forest model showed the highest accuracy and F1-score, making it the most suitable model for predicting bank customer churn in our evaluation.

Future Work
Explore more advanced models like Gradient Boosting and Neural Networks.
Implement feature engineering to improve model performance.
Evaluate model performance on a larger and more diverse dataset.
